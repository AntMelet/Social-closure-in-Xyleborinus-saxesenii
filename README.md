# Social-closure-in-Xyleborinus-saxesenii

Description: in this study we investigated the differences in chemical profiles between two populations of X. saxesenii. We also conducted introduction assays to investigate the possibility of behavioural reaction from the native individuals to the presence of a foreign beetle in the nest

In this repository, you will find the data collected. The files are organised in two folder:

1. Chemical analysis: This folder contains the data related to the analysis of the chemical profiles of the beetles. 
Chemical analysis: this file contains the relative abundances of the compounds identified in the profiles of X. saxesenii.

- population: we investigated two populations of X. saxesenii, one from the Steinbachtal forest in Wurzburg, Germany (SBT) and the second from a national park in Bavaria, Germany (BW)
- sample: each population was replicated 5 times
- other columns: each compound contributing to the chemical profile has a column
