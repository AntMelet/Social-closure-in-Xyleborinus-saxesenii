# Social-closure-in-Xyleborinus-saxesenii

Description: in this study we investigated the differences in chemical profiles between two populations of X. saxesenii. We also conducted introduction assays to investigate the possibility of behavioural reaction from the native individuals to the presence of a foreign beetle in the nest

In this repository, you will find the data collected. The files are organised in two folder:

1. Chemical analysis: This folder contains the data related to the analysis of the chemical profiles of the beetles. 

Chemical analysis.xlsx: this file contains the relative abundances of the compounds identified in the profiles of X. saxesenii.
- population: we investigated two populations of X. saxesenii, one from the Steinbachtal forest in Wurzburg, Germany (SBT) and the second from a national park in Bavaria, Germany (BW)
- sample: each population was replicated 5 times
- other columns: each compound contributing to the chemical profile has a column

2. Behavioural analysis: This folder contains the data related to the behaviour of the beetles. The data are organised in three files

Condition_after_24h.xlsx: this file contains the data about the condition of the introduced beetles 24h after introduction. Introduced beetles were observed alive or dead, in or out of the nest they have been introduced in. Some beetles were not observed and recorded as such.
- treatment: the origin of the introduced individual
- condition: the condition we observed the introduced individual
- value: how many beetles were observed in that condition
- survival: the alive/dead component of hte condition
- dispersal: the in/ out of the nest component of hte ocndition
- species: the species of hte introduced individual

Data_observations_focal.xlsx: this file contains the behaviours of the introduced individuals. The data were collected during 30 min after the introduction.
- nest_ID: each introduction assay used a different nest as the accepting nest
- treatment: the origin of the introduced individual
- date_nest: the date at which the accepting nest started
- date_observation: the date at which the observation was conducted
- age: the difference between the date o hte observation and the starting date of hte nest, in days
- total: the total duration of hte observation, in seconds
- out_of_view, R, W, D, F, C, S, G, Cop, Can: the cumulative duration of the respective behaviours, in seconds
- total_visible: the cumulative duration during whichthe individual was visible (= total duration - out_of_view)

Behaviors_scans.xlsx: this file contains the behaviours of the individuals of the receiving nest.
